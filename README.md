# Higurashi Steam Sprite/PS3 Background Patch
For Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni - Chapters 1-3 Onikakushi, Watanagashi, and Tatarigoroshi

This patch aims to work in conjunction with 07th-mod's PS3 Voice and Graphics Patch for episodes 1-3 of Higurashi. Simply use the link below to download the necessary files to mod your copy of the game, then download the appropriate steam sprites zip file and follow the README instructions to make use of 07th-mod's PS3 backgrounds and voices, but keep the original Steam sprites without breaking the game.

# Known Issues
The CG's use the art from the PS3 version of the game. Unfortunately, they would require far too much work to replace with Steam artwork equivalents, and much more technical knowhow to remove them outright. This will result in some CG's that are inconsistent with the sprite design, such as Shion, for example (Don't ask me why Alchemist decided to change her outfit when designing her PS3 sprites).
